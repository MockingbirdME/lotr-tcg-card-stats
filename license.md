# "THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42-13)
As long as you retain this notice you can do whatever you want with this stuff.
This line isn't enforceable but, come one, please don't use this stuff for evil. 
If we meet some day, and you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.   

- Devon Henegar
